<p>About Us<p/>
<p>At age 23, Bob Mills, newly graduated from college and stuck in a dead-end job as a typist, took a chance on opening his first furniture store at 2526 SW 29th in Oklahoma City. While there, the business thrived for many years, constantly growing before Bob had to move the business to a bigger location in the late 1980s, this is the same 110,000 square foot facility at 3600 W. Reno in Oklahoma City, and is now the flagship location of all our stores!</p>
<p>Our locations have grown from the original Oklahoma City, Corporate offices to Tulsa, Oklahoma, and our Texas locations, Lubbock, Amarillo, Temple, Waco, Midland, Odessa and San Antonio.</p>

<p>This year marks the golden anniversary for Furniture and You. Since 1971, Furniture and You has delivered 50 years of beautiful furniture. We have aimed to offer the greatest comfort and value, with elegant styles to match your taste, decor, and design. In addition to comfort and style, we have also made certain to offer brands with strong reputations and track records of durability so that you can enjoy your furniture investment for years to come.</p>

<p>Years have passed since Bob last promoted the store with a country-western band, and he's no longer wearing sweaters or proclaiming his store as "the working man's friend." But the memories are still there of how long it took to have success. Bob said, "Our success happened when we were able to start hiring some good employees. I'm a great believer that this is a people business. The people determine your success. The people determine whether you or your company will be successful. That first employee hired was back in 1976. Today, in 2021, we have a little over 400 employees and our success is a record that proves people made the difference."</p>
